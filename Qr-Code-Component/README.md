## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While building this project I learned to write minimal code without repeating.

```css
.container {
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

My future plan is to continue doing the challenges from the fronend mentor and improve on building fully responsive with the integrating the backend as well.
